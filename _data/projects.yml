  title: "Crush Cards"
  description: |
    This project sprang out of a desire to get people talking to the people it's hardest to be honest with: crushes. The crush (or the encounter) may have lasted one night, or have been stretching on silently for months, so Diana and I designed a to-the-point method of saying what you are too shy to say. 

    Inspired by 4th grade note passing, we set up the installation with a limiteless supply of cards and envelopes. Diana carved and stained the wood holders with her father. To our surprise, we refilled the installation several times before the evening was out. And more than one person came up to me afterwards to admit they had found a crush card which had been slipped into their bag or pocket. 

    We deemed the project a success, and look forward to future projects which continue to follow a similar mode of audience interaction.

    This piece was commissioned by the Brooklyn Arts Council.

    My jumping off point was the 20th poem from Pablo Neruda's "Twenty Love Poems and One Song of Despair". He wrote them when he was 19. The English translation of his poems always run alongside the original Spanish (most often by the most trusted translator of Neruda, W. S. Merwin). I have then run the English and the Spanish through online English/Spanish translator programs, back and forth on a continuous loop, and have printed out the original with all of the mistranslations. They are nestled in a Spanish - English dictionary.

    The Seven Deadly Sins of Times Square is a web-based map project that seeks to tie together, assemble, and present the rich historical dangers, pitfalls, and glories of Times Square. It attempts to be part regional travel guide, part map, part history lesson, part morbid fascination. 

    All of the information highlighted in the project is all publicly accessible and findable online (all links are included), and the code was built as open source, so that it can be utilized by others. You are invited to explore this map, and discover the layered history hidden beneath the modern veneer. 

    This project was done with the help of the very talented Patrick Filler (all things code) and Kim Ku (designer extraordinaire). Initially created as a public art project for The Work Office, this was a new version created for gallery installation, with cards that people can take with them, highlighting data points from the map.

    A love letter to Berlin, but also to Malmö, Buffalo, and Brooklyn.

The book looks deeply into memory and forward into possibility, traveling among many cities, sensing what echoes in the empty spaces inside an apartment, and what joy exists in the embrace of two people, walking arm in arm through an unknown city."

    We are interested in the concept of home: what makes it comfortable, how much space you need, and how our experience of our apartments shapes our ideas of home. Diana and I decided to build a home together by superimposing floorplans of our existing Brooklyn apartments, overlapping and intertwining the walls and furniture of each place to the other. 

    The apartments are represented in actual size, and much of the furniture was placed in the spaces from memory.

  description: |
    I have been working on this project of photographs of light, all taken in transit in various cities throughout the world, either from a subway, train, car, scooter, or plane. I began this project as a different way to approach landscape photography, and was delighted to find the abstract environments I could create, within the eye of the camera.

    This project is a shift for me from my usual subject of environmental portraiture, which has been a main focus for the past 15 years. I began taking these pictures in spaces that did not exist, in-between spaces, spaces in transition, cities beneath or above the actual cities. These pictures for me are also a leap into an abstracted emotional terrain, a place to experience that has no defining characteristic of a "city", but very much a specific emotional landscape.

    "The man who is traveling and does not yet know the city awaiting him along his route wonders what the palace will be like, the barracks, the mill, the theater, the bazaar. In every city of the empire every building is different and set in a different order: but as soon as the stranger arrives at the unknown city, and his eye penetrates the pine cone of pagodas and garrets and haymows, following the scrawl of canals, gardens, rubbish heaps, he immediately distinguishes which are the princes' palaces, the high priests' temples, the tavern, the prison, the slum. This —some say— confirms the hypothesis that each man bears in his mind a city made only of differences, a city without figures and without form, and the individual cities fill it up."

    Much of this work is taken in Buffalo, NY (my hometown). It is a series I am taking on the waterfront, and the areas surrounding the now defunct, or largely abandoned industries of steel and grain. Buffalo used to be the main repository for grain for the east coast, on its way to other destinations, and the steel industry dominated Buffalo's economy and job market for decades, until Bethlehem Steel closed its doors in 1989. Buffalo's economy and landscape have been drastically altered by these two industries, and many current policy and economic decisions are based on this rich, but abandoned, past.

    I have photographed these trees in a time of transition and change. They are living things changed by crisis, literally still standing, and adapting.

    This project sprang out of trying to figure out what to get two separate couples, who were getting married. Each couple had lived with each other for a while, and seemed to have pretty much all they'd need. I decided that my gift to them would be advice from others, about what they should know in the coming years - what people felt was the most important thing a newlywed couple should know. 

    I interviewed and photographed people on the streets of Brooklyn. The plexiglass is covered in plastic and paper flaps, which open to reveal the advice, and an image of the person who gave it. The flaps have different line drawings of instructions about how to tie knots.

    *Catcalling: n, a shrill whistle or cry used to express disapproval (from Webster's Universal Dictionary and Thesaurus, 1993, Geddes & Grosset, Ltd, Scotland)*

    *Street abuse:*
    1. *To hurt, on a public road, by treating badly*
    2. *Unintentional degradation through ignorance*
    3. *To imply a physical and/or emotional threat through gestures or posture*
    4. *Coarse, deceptive, or insulting language*
    5. *Unsolicited physical contact*
    6. *To stalk for purposes of either psychological or physical harm*
    7. *Unequal access on public roads*
    *(from [Maggie Hadleigh-West's site](https://www.yomaggie.com/))*

    My project "Innerviews" is grounded in the idea of exchange. In the context of this project, exchange is the way that we, as a community, give and receive reciprocally; an interchange. Often times I have felt powerless to participate in a dialogue with catcallers, because the comments were simply being said at me.

    This project completes the give and take by talking back. I have interviewed many different people to discuss catcalling, and its impact on our shared public space. The installation of books of these interviews invites the viewer to explore the pieces of this investigation, to open and touch and engage in the exchange, and to respond back in a journal set up next to the piece with comments or suggestions.

    I initially viewed catcalling as aggressive or negative attention, but this project constructs another way of engaging with it. I do not think catcalling is an issue to be polarized as "right" or "wrong". It is a complicated issue that needs to be explored and discussed, to better understand why it exists. Through a better understanding of what motivates this behavior, I hope that people will become aware of their contribution to creating the atmosphere of this city.

    Almost invariably, when one thinks of a successful artist, the first image that comes to mind is the lone individual, a man, painting with incredible seriousness and gravity a large canvas in a large room: the driven individual alone, in the throes of expression, a romantic figure. In training, we are encouraged to think in series, to create a cohesive body of "mature" work. We seek not to reject this, but to explore other possibilities for expression and communication.

    We began working on this book as a way to experiment with a medium that has fascinated both of us for quite some time: the book. Drawing from a rich history of sequential art, ranging from the dime store comic book, to the underground proliferation of xeroxed "zines", to the highly produced (and priced) "artist book", we decided to take what we thought was the best the medium has to offer. We are interested in producing something tactile, something that the viewer can hold in the palm of his or her hand, something intimate. We like the idea of producing a work, which is relatively cheap to purchase, a non-exclusive commodity that is available to all.

    As a partnership, we seek not to absolve the individual of responsibility for the product but to foster productivity through community, to become more effective through collaboration and to create work that is intimate and widely accessible. We seek to remove some of the deadly gravity from the process of creation without affecting the quality or the importance of the work, and this book is the first in a series of projects we hope to produce for this end.

    UVV sings in the polyphonic village style and its repertoire is constantly evolving, frequently focusing on seasonal celebrations, ritual songs, as well as lyrical music. We often sing songs recorded by ethnomusicologists from the oldest dwellers of villages in Ukraine.

    Since 2013, the ensemble has performed for a wide range of audiences in the New York metropolitan area and other locales in New York State, as well as in Canada. Venues have ranged from folk music and seasonal festivals to museums, theaters, libraries, community centers, church halls, and sidewalk, park, radio and webcast concerts. UVV has been featured at [Brooklyn Folk Festival](http://brooklynfolkfest.com/), [Zlatne Uste Golden Festival](https://goldenfest.org/), Roots n' Ruckus Fest, and [Saint George Ukrainian Festival](https://www.facebook.com/StGeorgesUkrainianFestivalNYC/).
